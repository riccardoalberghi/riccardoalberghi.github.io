I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence at Bocconi University, where I also earned my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences for AI. I work as a Research Assistant in the Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi.

My current research focuses on understanding reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). I develop controlled scenarios to isolate and study specific characteristics of LLMs. More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in how neural networks function and how we can better interpret and optimize them.

I have a passion for astronomy. I specialize in imaging deep space objects and contribute to the development of open-source image processing tools based on AI such as [GraXpert](https://graxpert.com/) and [Siril's aberration remover tool](https://gitlab.com/free-astro/siril-scripts).
